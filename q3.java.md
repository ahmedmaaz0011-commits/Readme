Discounted Selling price is to be calculated if original selling price and discount percentage
is given. Write a program to calculate and print discounted selling price of the user given
two inputs (1) original selling price and (2) discounted selling price in simple java.

## Copilot

Here is a simple Java program that takes the original selling price and the discount percentage as input from the user and calculates the discounted selling price.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DiscountCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Get inputs
        System.out.print("Enter the original selling price: ");
        double originalPrice = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the discount percentage: ");
        double discountPercent = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Calculate discounted price
        double discountAmount = (discountPercent / 100) * originalPrice;
        double discountedPrice = originalPrice - discountAmount;

        // Output the result
        System.out.printf("The discounted selling price is: %.2f\n", discountedPrice);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

**How it works:**
1. The program prompts the user to enter the original price and the discount percentage.
2. It calculates the discount amount by multiplying the original selling price by the discount percentage divided by 100.
3. The discounted price is then the original price minus the discount amount.
4. The result is displayed using two decimal places.

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter the original selling price: 1000
Enter the discount percentage: 20
The discounted selling price is: 800.00
```
